# CodeAndChords

Live music visualization project (in-progress) using the Processing language and Java Sound API.

## To run:
_Quick Demos:_
Download the appropriate "StartHere" folder for your OS; all the demos should run without additional software.

_Everything else:_
 1. Download Processing (https://processing.org/download/)
 2. Open and run any of the files in Visuals/Modules.
 
We recommend starting with "Module_02_PitchHueBars_EMM", "Module_01_01_PitchHueBackgroundWBorder_HPS_EMM_CURRENT" (both link pitch and color), and "Module_04_03_AmplitudeBars_SS_1Voice_EMM."

### Notate Bene:
 * Volume must be turned down or off to avoid feedback while running sketches.
 * Sketches in Visuals/Modules that are marked "MultipleIns", as well as those in July8Demos, will only work correctly if JACK (http://jackaudio.org/) is installed and running.
 * Sketches marked "SamplePlayer" will play and respond to a scale (or other audio) at runtime.
