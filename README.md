# CodeAndChords

Live music visualization project (in-progress) using the Processing language and Java Sound API; [here's a 3-minute overview.] (https://youtu.be/Y1x6bk8nvog)

## Quick Demos:
Download the appropriate "ModuleApps" folder for your OS ("MacApps", "PC-32bitApps" or "PC-64bitApps"); all the demos therein should run without requiring additional software.

## Everything Else:
 1. Download Processing (https://processing.org/download/)
 2. Open and run any of the files in Visuals/Processing/ProcessingModules.
 (Depending on the location of your default sketchbook, you may also have to import the Beads library.  To do this, go to "Sketch" => "Import Library" => "Add Library...", then search for and install Beads.)
 
We recommend starting with "Module_02_PitchHueBars_EMM", "Module_01_01_PitchHueBackgroundWBorder_HPS_EMM_CURRENT" (both link pitch and color), and "Module_04_03_AmplitudeBars_SS_1Voice_EMM."

(There are also Eclipse versions of some of the modules.)

### Notate Bene:
 * Volume must be turned down or off to avoid feedback while running sketches.
 * Sketches in Visuals/Modules that are marked "MultipleIns", as well as those in July8Demos, will only work correctly if JACK (http://jackaudio.org/) is installed and running.
 * Sketches marked "SamplePlayer" will play and respond to a scale (or other audio) at runtime.
