[primo] I love seeing you happy
I miss seeing that smile
It's been such a long time
And although I don't have you
I know now that I need to
And somehow make you mine
And I won't lie
It's hard seeing you with him
'Cause I know he can't hold you like I can
[together] Someday maybe when we're old and gray
We could be in love once more
Till then I won't give my love away
Darling, I'm forever only yours
[secondo] I remember that love song
I sang every word wrong
But you didn't mind; No, no
And I'll admit that I miss you
But only if you do
'Cause you know that I'm shy
And I can't lie
It's hard seeing you with her
'Cause I know she can't love you like I can
[together] Someday maybe when we're old and gray
We could be in love once more
Till then I won't give my love away
Darling, I'm forever only yours
If my loving works for you then
We got nothing to lose
'Cause I'm forever only yours (in love once more, once more, once more)
No need to complicate it
The smile is worth the wait, yeah
I'm forever only yours (hey, yeah)
Someday maybe
Someday maybe
Someday maybe I'll be yours (whoa, baby)
Someday maybe (someday maybe)
Someday maybe (someday maybe)
Someday maybe I'll be yours (someday maybe I'll be yours)
Someday maybe when we're old and gray
We could be in love once more
Till then I won't give my love away
Darling, I'm forever only yours
And my love then what's for you then
We all got nothing to lose
'Cause I'm forever only yours (someday I'll be yours)
No need to complicate it
The smile is worth the wait, yeah
I'm forever only yours (someday maybe...)
I'm forever only yours (only yours)
(I'm singing now)
I'm forever only yours...
