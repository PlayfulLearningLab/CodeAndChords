  Mathy, Matrix-inspired raining numbers.
  
  TODO:
   - Fix pile-up at the top of the list
   - Get average freq. over time, not just whatever second happens.
   - Silence holds the last number; probably don't want that?
   
   - Plotting points
   
   thoughts: maybe we don't want to start over until they're all gone?
             or start another column next to that, and start back at the first one when the second one finishes?
